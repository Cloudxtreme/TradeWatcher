TradeWatcher
============

Trade watcher for emulated Everquest server "Project 1999". Allows users to set up tracking of items they wish to buy or sell.
If a match is found a notification will be displayed in the system tray. This way, you can play the game and be notified when 
someone is buying or selling things you are interested in.

Relies on ahungry' eqauction feed for indata. http://ahungry.com/eqauctions/

Please note that this is a work in progress and probably wont work at all at times.
At the moment you will need to manually edit the textfiles sell.txt and buy.txt located under the TradeWatcher/res directory.
See todo.txt for coming functionality.
